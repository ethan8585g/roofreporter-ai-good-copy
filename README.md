## Roofer Secretary AI — Phone Number Configuration

### How It Works
Each Secretary AI customer needs **two phone numbers**:

| # | Phone | Description | Who Provides It |
|---|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Personal Phone** | Customer's personal cell — they forward calls FROM this number when unavailable | Customer already has this |
| 2 | **Agent Phone (SIP)** | Purchased SIP/VoIP number the AI agent uses for inbound & outbound calls | Customer purchases from Twilio/Vonage/Telnyx |

### Call Flow
```
Homeowner calls roofer → Roofer's Personal Cell
  ↓ (busy / after hours / no answer)
  → Call forwards to Agent Phone Number (SIP)
  → LiveKit AI Secretary picks up
  → Handles call (FAQ, booking, message, transfer)
  → Notifies roofer via SMS/email
```

### Pre-Configured Account
- **dev@reusecanada.ca** → Agent Phone: `+1 (484) 964-9758` (pre-owned LiveKit number)
- Provider: LiveKit (auto-assigned on account creation)

### New Customer Setup
1. Customer purchases a SIP phone number from a provider:
   - **Twilio**: https://www.twilio.com/en-us/phone-numbers
   - **Vonage**: https://www.vonage.com/communications-apis/phone-numbers/
   - **Telnyx**: https://telnyx.com/products/phone-numbers
2. Enter their personal phone + agent phone in the onboarding form
3. Configure call forwarding on their cell provider:
   - **Telus**: `*21*[agent_number]#`
   - **Rogers**: `**21*[agent_number]#`
   - **Bell**: `*72[agent_number]`
4. Secretary AI is live — calls forward to AI when customer is unavailable

## Recommended Next Steps

### Phase 1: Platform Improvements (Immediate)

#### User Experience
1. **Onboarding Wizard** — Replace static login with a guided 3-step signup: Business Info → Plan Selection → Payment. Reduces drop-off from registration to first report.
2. **Customer Notification Center** — Real-time toast notifications when reports complete, proposals are viewed, payments received. Push notifications via service worker for mobile.
3. **Multi-Language Support** — Add French (Quebec market) and Spanish (US expansion). Use i18n JSON files with Cloudflare Workers locale detection.
4. **Dark Mode Toggle** — Customer dashboard dark mode. Already have dark styling in visualizer — extend to CRM views.
5. **Keyboard Shortcuts** — Power users want: `N` = new order, `R` = refresh, `Esc` = close modal. Add command palette (Ctrl+K).
6. **Bulk Operations** — Select multiple orders/proposals for batch email, export CSV, or status change.

#### Authentication & Security
7. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** — Add TOTP-based 2FA using Web Crypto OTP generation. Essential for admin/superadmin accounts.
8. **OAuth Login** — Add "Login with Google" and "Login with Apple" via OAuth 2.0. Reduces signup friction for contractors who dislike password forms.
9. **Session Management** — Add "Active Sessions" view showing logged-in devices. Allow remote session revocation.
10. **Rate Limiting** — Implement per-IP and per-user rate limits on API endpoints to prevent abuse.

### Phase 2: Roof Report Improvements

#### Measurement Accuracy
11. **Multi-Source Satellite Imagery** — Integrate Nearmap or EagleView API alongside Google Solar for higher-resolution aerial images (5cm vs 50cm). Fall back gracefully.
12. **LiDAR Integration** — When available, accept LiDAR point cloud uploads (.las/.laz files). Process in Workers using a lightweight parser for sub-inch accuracy.
13. **Manual Measurement Editor** — Allow roofers to draw/adjust roof segments on the satellite image. Canvas-based polygon editor with drag handles.
14. **Historical Comparison** — Store previous reports for same address. Show change detection (new damage, added structures, vegetation growth).
15. **Weather Overlay** — Pull historical hail/storm data from NOAA for the property address. Auto-flag properties in recent storm paths.

#### Report Quality
16. **PDF Export (Native)** — Replace browser print-to-PDF with server-side PDF generation using Cloudflare Browser Rendering API or Puppeteer on a Cloudflare Durable Object.
17. **Report Templates** — Let roofers customize report branding (logo placement, color scheme, footer text) via a template editor. Store in D1.
18. **Material Pricing Integration** — Pull real-time shingle pricing from distributor APIs (ABC Supply, Beacon Roofing). Auto-update proposal costs.
19. **Insurance Supplement Report** — Generate Xactimate-compatible reports. Parse damage findings into insurance supplement line items.
20. **Video Walkthrough** — Generate a short AI narrated video (via ElevenLabs TTS + image slideshow) summarizing the report findings. Embed in customer-facing proposals.

### Phase 3: Visual & Frontend Improvements

#### 3D Visualizer Enhancements
21. **Actual Roof Geometry** — Use the report's facet data to build the actual measured roof shape in Three.js, not just a generic house model.
22. **Texture Mapping** — Replace flat color swatches with real shingle texture images (bump maps + normal maps for realistic appearance).
23. **AR Mode** — Add WebXR support so homeowners can view the 3D model in augmented reality on their phone, projected onto their actual house.
24. **Before/After Slider** — Side-by-side comparison: current roof satellite image vs. proposed new roof color. Draggable slider.
25. **Solar Panel Overlay** — Show potential solar panel placement on the 3D model using Google Solar sunlight data. Cross-sell opportunity.

#### Landing Page & Marketing
26. **Animated Hero Section** — Replace static hero with a Three.js mini-scene showing a house getting a new roof. Parallax scroll effects.
27. **Customer Testimonials Carousel** — Auto-rotate video testimonials from satisfied roofers. Social proof increases conversion.
28. **Live Demo Mode** — Let visitors generate a sample report for a demo address without logging in. Capture email for follow-up.
29. **SEO Optimization** — Add structured data (JSON-LD) for local business schema. Generate city-specific landing pages (/edmonton-roof-reports, /calgary-roof-measurement).
30. **Blog/Content Hub** — Add a blog section for SEO. Topics: "How Satellite Roof Measurement Works", "Insurance Claims After Hail Season", "Alberta Roofing Code Updates".

### Phase 4: iOS App Store Deployment

    - Use [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) by Ionic to wrap the existing web app in a native iOS shell
    - `npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/ios`
    - `npx cap init RoofReporterAI com.roofreporterai.app`
    - `npx cap add ios && npx cap open ios`
    - Your existing Hono/Tailwind frontend loads inside a native WKWebView
    - Add native plugins: Push Notifications, Camera, Geolocation, Haptics
    - Sign with Apple Developer certificate ($99/yr) → Submit to App Store
    - Cost: ~$99/yr Apple Developer, Time: 1-2 weeks
    - **This is the fastest path to the App Store**

33. **Native Features via Capacitor Plugins**
    - `@capacitor/camera` — Take photos of roof damage on-site

    - Privacy Policy URL (already at `/privacy`)
    - App Review Guidelines compliance: no web-only wrapper — must add native functionality
    - Estimated review time: 1-3 business days

35. **React Native Rebuild — Long Term (Optional)**
    - Full native rebuild if performance demands exceed Capacitor's capabilities
    - Share backend (Cloudflare Workers) — only rebuild frontend
    - Use React Navigation, React Native Paper/NativeWind for UI
    - Cost: 2-4 months development, but best native performance
    - Only recommended if App Store review rejects Capacitor wrapper

### Phase 5: Revenue & Growth

36. **Subscription Tiers** — Expand from single credit-pack model to monthly plans:
    - **Starter** ($49/mo): 10 reports, basic CRM
    - **Professional** ($149/mo): 50 reports, full CRM, Secretary AI
    - **Enterprise** ($499/mo): Unlimited reports, white-label, API access, priority support

37. **White-Label Program** — Allow roofing companies to rebrand the platform entirely. Custom domain, logo, colors, email templates. $999 setup + $299/mo.

38. **Affiliate/Referral Program** — Roofers refer other roofers → earn commission or free credits. Viral growth in tight-knit roofing communities.

39. **Insurance Adjuster Portal** — Dedicated portal for insurance adjusters to order damage assessments. Different pricing tier. Massive TAM.

40. **Supplier Marketplace** — Connect roofers with material suppliers. ABC Supply, Beacon, SRS. Earn referral fees on material orders placed through the platform.
